## Classic

PitBull works with WoW Classic! Some things that are different from retail:

- Health is only reported as the percentage (0-100). PitBull supports showing
  actual values if you also install [Real Mob Health](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/real-mob-health).
- Aura duration is not available from the API, so PitBull uses [LibClassicDurations](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/libclassicdurations)
  to show them. The duration can be inaccurate if it's affected by rank or
  talents.
- Cast info is only available for your spells from the API. PitBull uses [LibClassicCasterino](https://github.com/rgd87/LibClassicCasterino)
  to show cast bars for other units, but this can be inaccurate since there is
  a lot of guess-work involved.
